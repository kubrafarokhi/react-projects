/* As an organization admin, I want the ability to create different types of forms which I can share with my org members. (Think of Google Forms)

Requirements
I should be able to provide a title to the form
I should have the option to add following questions - Text field, Dropdown & Checkbox
Each question should have a label
Each question card should have following features - move up, move down, copy and delete
I should be able to save the form once I’ve added all the questions and the title


You don’t need to worry about CSS, we are interested only in the HTML & JS part. Feel free to use any framework. The code should be clean, maintainable and extensible. */
